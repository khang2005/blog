# Introduction to Promise class
{% raw %}
A Promise class represents an operation that hasn't completed yet but is 
expected to be completed inthe future. We know that the .then or .catch 
functions are invoked asynchronously when the promised result (or error) 
is available. 
Inside and async funtion, the await keyword is available to automatically 
wait for a Promise to resolve. It returns the result of a Promise, or else 
throws errors, inthe natural location at the next line of code, while also
accommodating asynchronous execution.
